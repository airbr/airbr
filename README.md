### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Morgan.

I work at [WompMobile](https://wompmobile.com) as a Production Developer. Before that I worked as a remote developer for [EasyRx](https://easyrxcloud.com) with a focus on the web for over 4 years.
 
The best way to find out all about me is at [my minimalist personal website](https://morganwebdev.com) and my [About section on my developer blog](https://www.morganwebdev.org/about/) 

âš¡ Fun fact: I am a participant/member of [Bellingham Codes](https://bellingham.codes) and it is my favorite programming community by far!

I am a very happy MDN Plus Web Docs subscriber
