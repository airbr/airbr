### I have a [website](https://morganwebdev.org). It has an RSS Feed and links to this GitHub profile.

I have approximately 9+ years of experience working on the web as a developer. Before that I blogged in University around 2011-2014. I have made some contributions at the W3C, particularly in the Sustainable Web Interest Group. I have also made very small contributions to other projects that I think are valuable.

I like music! physical and digital media, including Vinyl, CD's, MP3's, FLAC and more.
