### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Morgan.

I currently work as a remote software developer for [EasyRx](https://easyrxcloud.com) with a focus on the web. EasyRx runs on the LAMP Stack mainly and I work across the full stack. I have worked there since 2017 and witnessed the evolution of features I have made in production. 
 
I am a problem solver. If something can be solved by deleting a few lines of code that is sometimes the best solution in the situation. I use tools you may have heard of like Google and Stack Overflow for many problems... what is important to me is that I have worked on my critical thinking skills to know how to interpret this information and avoid reinventing the wheel where I can.

The best way to find out all about me is at [my minimalist personal website](https://morganwebdev.com) and my [about section on my blog](https://www.morganwebdev.org/about/) 

âš¡ Fun fact: I am a participant/member of [Bellingham Codes](https://bellingham.codes) and it is my favorite programming community by far!
