### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Morgan.

I am currently working full-time remote as a web developer at [EasyRx](https://easyrxcloud.com). I have worked their since 2017. It is great to have a job that challenges me every day. EasyRx runs on the LAMP Stack mainly and I work across the full stack.
 
I am a problem solver. If something can be solved by deleting a few lines of code that is sometimes the best.

I use tools you may have heard of like Google and Stack Overflow for most things. What is important to me is that I have critical thinking skills to know what is a good solution or resource for the job at hand.

The best way to find out all about me is at [my minimalist personal website](https://morganwebdev.com) 

âš¡ Fun fact: I am a member of [Bellingham Codes](https://bellingham.codes) and it is my FAVORITE programming community by far!

> My favorite repository right now is airbr/onefile. Its just where I feel I am expressing my personality heh.
