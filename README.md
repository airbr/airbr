### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Morgan.

###### fun fact:  My first name is Beau, but I go by my middle name/preferred name Morgan 

I have [a website](https://morganwebdev.com) and a [developer blog](https://www.morganwebdev.org/). 

I have made small contributions to the [MDN Web Docs](https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/24346#issuecomment-1493051463), [Sustainable Web Design Community Group](https://github.com/w3c/sustyweb/releases/tag/v1.0-D2), and [WebPageTest documentation](https://github.com/WPO-Foundation/webpagetest-docs/pull/81) as some examples of open source contributions. This profile is mostly personal projects to learn new things. 

I am an American New Zealander and I aspire to be tangata Tiriti, To be a person of the Treaty, and I incorporate it into my work.
