### Hi there 👋 My name is Morgan.

The best way to find out all about me are links at [my website](https://morganwebdev.com) and my [developer blog](https://www.morganwebdev.org/). 

Most of my work has been paid work that I can't share. However , I have made small contributions to [MDN Web Docs](https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/24346#issuecomment-1493051463) and [WebPageTest documentation](https://github.com/WPO-Foundation/webpagetest-docs/pull/81) as some examples of open source contributions. This profile is mostly side personal projects to learn new things.
