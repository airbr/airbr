### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Morgan here. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on EasyRx. It is great to have a job that challenges me every day. 

In my spare time I try to help out at Open Law NZ, a open source non profit. 

The best way to find out all about me is at [my minimalist personal website](https://morganwebdev.com)
