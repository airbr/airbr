### I have a [website](https://morganwebdev.org). It has an RSS Feed and links to this GitHub profile.

I have approximately 9+ years of experience working on the web. I have made some contributions at the W3C, particularly in the Sustainable Web Interest Group. I have also made very small contributions to OpenLaw, WebPageTest, MDN Web Docs and other projects that I think are valuable.

I like music! Mixed-media, including Vinyl, CD's, MP3's, FLAC and more.
