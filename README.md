### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Morgan*.

I am open to opportunities. 

I worked recently at [WompMobile](https://wompmobile.com) as a Production Developer and before that I worked as a remote developer for [EasyRx](https://easyrxcloud.com) with a focus on the web. I have about 5.5+ years experience doing software and web development. 

I have a law degree from Otago University, Dunedin, New Zealand and did a Web Development Immersive bootcamp with General Assembly in 2016.
 
The best way to find out all about me is at [my minimalist personal website](https://morganwebdev.com) and my [About section on my developer blog](https://www.morganwebdev.org/about/) 

I also have a [Glitch](https://glitch.com/@airbr) and a [Replit](https://replit.com/@airbr)


*My full name is Beau Morgan Murrah. I prefer Morgan generally.
