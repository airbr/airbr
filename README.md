### I have a [website](https://morganwebdev.org). It has an RSS Feed and links to this GitHub profile.

#### I have approximately 8.5+ years of experience working on the web. I have made some contributions at the W3C, particularly in the Sustainability Interest Group. I have also made very small contributions to OpenLaw, WebPageTest, MDN Web Docs and other projects that I think are valuable.
